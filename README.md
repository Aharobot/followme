This ros software can detect and track people, and can distinguish people.
I am using CamShift to track people, and using the kinect to calculate the distance of the people.
I'm using Propotional Navigation to track people. Also you can use the PD distance control by modificating the code a little. I have made the PD controller, so you just have to tune the parameters and have to make it publish to the motor topic.

Benchmarked in RoboCup Japan Open@home SPL league, scored 181 points.
